>For today’s junior developers: Maybe you’ll find something here you currently believe, and get inspired to learn more about it and why the topic is so multi-faceted. Or maybe you’ll find this post encouraging because you’re already so far ahead of where I was at your stage.

>For today’s senior developers: Maybe you can relate, and also have some funny (and humbling) stories to share about your own life lessons when you were a junior dev.
>To be clear, I think junior developers are awesome and just showing up to learn already takes a ton of courage. This post is about my own journey and learnings, and isn’t meant to be a generalization about how all junior devs think or behave.

## Absolute Truths I Unlearned as a Junior Developer
### 1. I'm a senior developer
- Not all experience is created equal.
  - Student and personal, private (non-income) does not necessarily count as work experience
  - If your code is never reviewed by other devs, you will not learn as fast as you can - by an enormous factor
- That's why mentors are so important.
  - the team you work with is so much more than a couple bucks in your paycheck - the team is the real value
- Job titles don't "make" you anything.
  - Just because you have a senior job title doesn't mean you are a senior dev
  - hierarchical titles are inherently flawed
  
### 2. Everyone writes tests
- Programming in research is completely different than programming in the industry
- Showed up to first industry job and realized they had no tests at all
  - and no one had a problem with there being no tests
  - eventually added automated tests to environments
- Loads of companies and startups have little or no tests
  - neglect testing early on
  - 
- No company has a perfect tech setup
- Being overly opinionated on topics you lack real-world experience with is pretty arrogant
  - It's important to have principles, but also to be open and truly interested other people's experiences and perspectives
  
  
### 3. We're so far behind everyone else (AKA "tech FOMO <fear of missing out>")
- Many conference talks cover proof of concepts rather than real-world scenarios.
- Dealing with legacy is completely normal
  - Legacy code is normal, and learning to deal with it will often teach you more than building apps from scratch because you'll be more exposed to concepts you don't understand yet.
  
  
### 4. Code quality matters most
- Good enough is good enough
  - doesn't have to be perfectly clean to get the job done and not be a total disaster to maintain
- Architecture is more important than nitpicking
  - focus more on the structure of the application than tiny bits of code early on
- Code quality is important


### 5. Everything must be documented!!
- Documentation lies sometimes
  - just because documentation is hard work, doesn't mean it's not worth doing at all - you have to document things the right way 
  - Over-documentation of the wrong things tends to lead to staleness, which can be just as confusing to people who are trying to fix an issue
- Focus on automation over documentation where appropiate
  - write good tests with clear language
  - automating the installation of an app with a few comments
  
### 6. Technical debt is bad
- Disorganized or messy code isn't the same as technical debt
  - technical debt actually slows you down in some way
- Having some technical debt is healthy
  - Having some pieces of code that are in fact "technical debt" is okay, so long as you recognize you'll likely need to pay that debt back

### 7. Seniority means being the best at programming
- Senior engineers must develop many skills besides programming
  - ranging from communication, and dependency management to sharing context, project management, estimation, and sucessfully collaborating with non-developer peers
- Not everyone will become "senior" during thier career
- We're all still junior in some areas
